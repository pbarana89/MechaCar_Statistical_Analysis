## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

[!](
The information shows that vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35 x 10-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero. The linear model with such a low p-value also shows that it does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

[!](

The design on the suspension coils for the MechaCar show interesting data. Both the first and second lot have variances that are rather small with Lot 1 being 0.97 and Lot 2 being 7.46. However the third lot shows a variance of 170.28. This would show that the first and second lot meet the specifications while the 3rd fails the 100 pounds per square inch requirement.
